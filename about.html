  <h4>About Me</h4>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
     I am a passionate student currently pursuing his career at SAE Instute. I am doing my second year in Game Development, but it is my third year at the Institute. It is not because I failed a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is because of misfortunate challenges, including a major setback in 2023 due to a car accident. My journey to being a game developer almost came to an end â€” but I returned stronger and more motivated than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides chasing my dream of becoming a game developer, I have many other skills and talents which I showcase in the home page.
